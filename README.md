# Pneumonia-Detection-System-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This project implements a binary classification system that analyzes chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system distinguishes between "Normal" and "Pneumonia" cases, achieving typical accuracies of 85-95% with proper implementation.
